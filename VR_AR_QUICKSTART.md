## 🎮 First-Time Tips

### For VR:
1. **Start with preview mode** - Click VR buttons without headset to see 3D preview
2. **Ensure good lighting** - VR tracking works best in well-lit rooms
3. **Clear play space** - Make sure you have room to move around safely
4. **Start simple** - Try VR Code View with a small file first
5. **Take breaks** - Stop if you feel any discomfort

### For AR:
1. **Test surface detection** - Wave phone slowly over desk/table
2. **Stand back** - 2-3 feet from surface works best for placement
3. **Good lighting crucial** - AR needs clear view of surface
4. **Start small** - Place one code file first to test
5. **Experiment with angles** - View code from different positions

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "WebXR not supported"
- Update your browser to the latest version
- Check device compatibility list above
- For VR: Ensure headset is connected
- For AR: Use Chrome on Android

### VR session won't start
1. **Check headset connection** - Ensure USB/wireless is connected
2. **Restart browser** - Close and reopen
3. **Allow permissions** - Click "Allow" when WebXR requests access
4. **Restart headset** - Full power cycle

### AR surface detection failing
1. **Improve lighting** - Turn on room lights
2. **Try different surface** - Use a table or floor
3. **Move slower** - Wave phone gently
4. **Restart AR session** - Exit and try again

### Performance issues
1. **Close other tabs** - Free up memory
2. **Reduce code size** - Smaller files render faster
3. **Lower quality** - Use performance settings
4. **Restart device** - Clear memory
